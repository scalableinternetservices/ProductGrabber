The BF-F9 v2+ is always imported by sea and not air - so by the time it even hits the market for re-sell it is already MONTHS outdated. --- The BF-F9 v2+ does not include the high gain antenna, but comes with the UV-5R antenna. --- The BF-F9 v2+ has a small 1500mAh battery (our battery is 30% larger) --- It does not always include the earpiece for quick communication. ---  The BF-F9 v2+ includes the old original manual - and does not include our full manual (which is 3 times larger) for operating your new radio.\n"], ["photo_file_name", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gegqBSthL.jpg"], ["url", "http://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-BF-F8HP-136-174Mhz-400-520Mhz-Includes/dp/B00MAULSOK%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAIOIQ7RVLXBLE63QA%26tag%3Dfasthall-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00MAULSOK"], ["rating", 4.4], ["created_at", "2015-11-05 20:29:11.408443"], ["updated_at", "2015-11-05 20:29:11.408443"]]

Why? Because they're simply superior to the competitors and here's why...\nYou may have noticed other sunshades made of thin static cling material. Unfortunately, our experience led us to believe that material is not the best for your automobile being susceptible to fall off glass and wrinkle, with a less than luxury appearance.\nInstead, we made the conscious decision to put high quality PVC protective blinds on a deluxe roller shade.  And we chose a white exterior to reflect sunlight, and black interior to reduce glare. It's tear resistant and gives you the high-end look we're all going for.  And best of all, it stays connected because we give you 3 attachment options.\nWhy don't others use it? Because it costs more to make. And ya, we could have saved money too but instead we set out to achieve a premium car window screen without having to break the bank to get it to you.\nAnd it seems like we achieved that based on what our customers are saying because they're enthusiastically praising this heat reducing privacy screen as one of the best they've ever used, even ones they paid more money for in the past.
